Galvanize first quarter project

This website utilizes the Sunlight Foundation (ProPublica) API to gather and display congressional data.  The site was styled with the Materialize CSS framework, which allowed for customized icon and form options and is deployed via firebase.\  The site asks for the users zip code and subsequently displays senator and representative information.  The information displayed is name, title, party affiliation, twitter/facebook information, phone, email, and website information.
